Hello, 

To ensure Jupyter notebook runs without errors, open in VS code. In VS code, via terminal you can run jupyter notebook in terminal. Alternatively, running through VS code should run as well.

Please clone the folder to avoid path errors when accesseing the csv files in Resources folder.

The challenge was to district and school summaries within two datasets to analyze similarities and potential trends on what is working and opportunities to focus on. The notebook includes vast categories ranging from student scores, school size, school spending, budget and so on. There is also a written analysis included.

Within the pandas-challenge folder, there is the PyCitySchools folder which contains the Resources folder and PyCitySchools jupyter notebook with the assignment completed.

Worked as a group with Sultan Raheem, Robert Molenda, Lucas Perez.

I appreciate your time!
