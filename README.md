Hello, 

To ensure Jupyter notebook runs without errors, open in VS code. In VS code, via terminal you can run jupyter notebook in terminal. Alternatively, running through VS code should run as well.

Please clone the folder to avoid path errors when accesseing the csv files in Resources folder.

Within the pandas-challenge folder, there is the PyCitySchools folder which contains the Resources folder and PyCitySchools jupyter notebook with the assignment completed.

I appreciate your time!
